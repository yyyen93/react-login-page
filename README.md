### Steps

1. __Styles.js (All styles components)__
   1. import styled-components - style the app
   2. import react-router-dom - to create button

2. __All image in assets.__
3. __App.js__
    1. import StyledContainer from components Styles.js
        i. styled components : Not default export. we need to wrap with curly braces.
    2. wrap whole app in a router that comes from react-router-dom
    3. Set Route for each component so that we don't need to replace each time we want to see the output.
       * to do this, we make use of the Routes and also the Route.
       * the Routes will check for the current link and choose which component to display.
       * Each of the Route will take a path which it associates with our components and also the element props, we can pass a dynamic value to element. dynamic value is that to be rendered component as JSX.
4. __Home.js__
    1. import StyledTitle,StyledSubTitle, Avatar, StyledButton, ButtonGroup from components Styles.js
        1. Avatar is the background image.
    2. import Logo from assets
    3. import StyledButton from Styles.js
        1. create a button for login and sign up
        2. specify the links where buttons point 'to'
5. __Login.js__
    1. use formik to build form.
        1. Formik tag will take function as a child, and this contain our form
        2. The form must ensure usability & high level of abstraction, we want to put formik input in another file.
        3. The file name 'FormLib.js'
            1. formik uses 'useField' which comes from itself package.
            2. {...props} : take props as parameter
            3. using the props will set up a formik field
            4. field and meta variable contains information about the field.
            5. import 'StyledIcon' from Styles.js
            6. Code Eye icon for the password field.
        4. formik property which is 'submitter'
            1. this returns a boolean true or false to indicate when our form is submitted.
            2. using this we can know when to display our loader spinner.
            3. isSubmitting as a parameter.
            4. import react-loader-spinner CSS.
                1. import {RotatingLines} from 'react-loader-spinner';
    2. import StyledTextInput,StyledLabel,StyledFormArea,StyledFormButton,Avatar,StyledTitle,colors,ButtonGroup from Styles.js

### Authentication
  
1. Require reacts and redux packages. Npm install them.
    * redux
    * react-redux
    * redux-thunk
    * redux-react-session (Error), try npm install redux-react-session --legacy-peer-deps
    * @reduxjs/toolkit
2. Create folder 'auth'
    * store.js
      * it contains the boilerplate for redux. All are required.
      * Please take note for the sessionService. As it no longer maintains. So it currently installed as '--legacy-peer-deps'
    * Subfolder actions and userActions.js
    * Subfolder reducers and rootReducer.js
      * Concepts of reducer is to interact with our store and change up values whenever it's needed.
